Git can sometimes present challenges when working on projects. Here are some common issues you might encounter and their solutions:

### Common Git Issues and Solutions

| Issue                                      | Solution                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Merge Conflict**                         | Resolve conflicts by editing conflicting files and committing changes. |
| **Forgot to Add Files Before Committing**   | Add missed files using `git add` and amend your commit with `git commit --amend`. |
| **Detached HEAD State**                    | Reattach HEAD to a branch using `git checkout -b new-branch HEAD`. |
| **Accidental Commit to Wrong Branch**       | Cherry-pick commits to the correct branch using `git cherry-pick` or reset using `git reset`. |
| **Forgot to Push Changes**                  | Push commits to remote using `git push`.                        |
| **Untracked Files**                        | Add untracked files to `.gitignore` or stage them using `git add`. |

### Example Troubleshooting

1. **Merge Conflict:**
   ```sh
   # Edit conflicting files
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
   ```

2. **Detached HEAD State:**
   ```sh
   git checkout -b new-branch HEAD
   ```

## Debugging Tools üõ†Ô∏èüîç

Git provides several tools to help debug issues and understand what‚Äôs happening in your repository.

### Useful Debugging Tools

2. **git reflog:**
   - View a detailed history of all Git actions, including resets and rebases.
   ```sh
   git reflog
   ```

3. **git diff:**
   - Compare changes between commits, branches, or files.
   ```sh
   git diff HEAD~1..HEAD
   ```

### Example Usage

1. **View Commit History:**
   ```sh
   git log
   ```

2. **View Detailed History:**
