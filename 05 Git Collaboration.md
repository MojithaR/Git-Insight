# 5. Git Collaboration

## Remote Repositories üåê

Remote repositories are versions of your project hosted on the internet or another network. They allow you to collaborate with others by sharing your code and changes.

### How to Work with Remote Repositories

1. **Add a Remote Repository:**
   ```sh
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```
   This command links your local repository to a remote one.

2. **Push Changes to Remote:**
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```
   This uploads your local changes to the remote repository.

3. **Pull Changes from Remote:**
   ```sh
   git pull origin main
   ```
   This fetches the latest changes from the remote repository and merges them into your local repository.

| Command                                     | Description                                  |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git` | Link your local repo to a remote repo |
| `git push origin main`                      | Push local changes to the remote repo        |
| `git pull origin main`                      | Pull changes from the remote repo            |

Remote repositories are essential for collaboration, allowing multiple people to work on the same project from different locations.

## Forking üç¥

Forking a repository creates a personal copy of someone else's project on your GitHub account. This is useful for contributing to other projects without affecting the original repository.

### How to Fork a Repository

1. **Fork on GitHub:** Go to the repository you want to fork and click the "Fork" button.
2. **Clone Your Fork:** Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository.git
   ```

### Example Workflow

1. **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button on GitHub.
2. **Clone Your Fork:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository.git
   ```
3. **Make Changes:** Edit files and commit changes.
4. **Push Changes to Your Fork:**
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```

### Summary Table

| Step                     | Description                                  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Fork on GitHub           | Create a copy of the repository on your account|
| `git clone URL`          | Clone your fork to your local machine        |
| `git push origin main`   | Push changes to your fork                    |

Forking is a great way to contribute to open-source projects and work on your own copy of a repository.

## Pull Requests üîÑ

A pull request (PR) is a way to propose changes to a repository. You make changes in your forked repository, and then create a PR to have those changes reviewed and potentially merged into the original repository.

### How to Create a Pull Request

1. **Make Changes in Your Fork:** Clone your fork, create a new branch, make your changes, and push them to GitHub.
   ```sh
   git checkout -b new-feature
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   git push origin new-feature
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request:** Go to the original repository on GitHub, click "New Pull Request," and select your branch with the new changes.

### Example Workflow

1. **Clone Your Fork and Create a Branch:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository.git
   cd repository
   git checkout -b new-feature
   ```

2. **Make Changes and Push:**
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   git push origin new-feature
   ```

3. **Create the Pull Request:** Go to the original repository on GitHub, click "New Pull Request," and select your branch.

### Summary Table

| Step                            | Description                                  |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `git checkout -b new-feature`   | Create a new branch for your feature         |
| `git add .`                     | Stage your changes                           |
| `git commit -m "Add new feature"` | Commit your changes                        |
| `git push origin new-feature`   | Push your changes to your fork               |
| Create Pull Request on GitHub   | Propose your changes to be merged            |

Pull requests facilitate collaboration by allowing others to review your changes and discuss potential modifications before integrating them into the main project.
