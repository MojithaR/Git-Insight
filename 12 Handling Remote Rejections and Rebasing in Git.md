# Handling Remote Rejections and Rebasing in Git 🚀

Sometimes when working with remote repositories, you might encounter errors when trying to push your changes. One common error is the dreaded `non-fast-forward` rejection. Don't worry, this guide will walk you through how to handle it using rebase and push your changes successfully! 🌟

## Scenario: Pushing to a Remote Repository

### Problem Statement 🛑

You tried pushing your changes to the remote repository and received this error:

```sh
error: failed to push some refs to 'http://your-remote-repository.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
```

### Solution Steps 🛠️

Here's how you can resolve this issue using `fetch`, `rebase`, and `push` commands.

1. **Check Your Branch Status**
    ```sh
    git status
    ```
    Ensure your working tree is clean. If not, add and commit your changes.

2. **Fetch the Latest Changes from Remote**
    ```sh
    git fetch origin
    ```

3. **Rebase Your Local Branch with Remote Changes**
    ```sh
    git rebase origin/your-branch-name
    ```
    This command will reapply your local commits on top of the fetched branch.

4. **Resolve Any Conflicts**
    If there are any merge conflicts, Git will pause and prompt you to resolve them. Follow these steps:
    - Edit the conflicted files to resolve the conflicts.
    - Stage the resolved files:
      ```sh
      git add .
      ```
    - Continue the rebase process:
      ```sh
      git rebase --continue
      ```

5. **Push Your Changes to the Remote Repository**
    ```sh
    git push -u origin your-branch-name
    ```

### Real-World Example 🌍

Here’s an example of a step-by-step process to push changes when encountering the `non-fast-forward` error.

```sh
$ git status
On branch kiosk_july_08
nothing to commit, working tree clean

$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
On branch kiosk_july_08
nothing to commit, working tree clean

$ git remote add origin http://code.AGMNSinnovations.com/Barista/valet/valetmanager-kiosk-mvvm.git
error: remote origin already exists.

$ git push -u origin kiosk_july_08
To http://code.breadcrumbsinnovations.com/parkfinda/valet360/valetmanager-kiosk-mvvm.git
 ! [rejected]        kiosk_july_08 -> kiosk_july_08 (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'http://code.AGMNSinnovations.com/Barista/valet/valetmanager-kiosk-mvvm.git'

$ git fetch origin

$ git rebase origin/kiosk_july_08
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/kiosk_july_08.

$ git push -u origin kiosk_july_08

| Command                       | Description                                                                            |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `git status`                  | Check the current status of your working directory and staging area.                   |
| `git add .`                   | Stage all changes for the next commit.                                                 |
| `git commit -m "message"`     | Commit the staged changes with a message.                                              |
| `git fetch origin`            | Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository without merging.                   |
| `git rebase origin/branch`    | Reapply your local commits on top of the fetched branch.                               |
| `git add .`                   | Stage resolved changes after a conflict.                                               |
| `git rebase --continue`       | Continue the rebase process after resolving conflicts.                                 |
| `git push -u origin branch`   | Push your changes to the remote repository and set the upstream tracking reference.     |

### Tips & Tricks 💡

- **Always Pull Before You Push:** It's a good habit to always pull the latest changes before you start working. This helps minimize conflicts and ensures your branch is up-to-date.
- **Understand Fast-Forward vs. Non-Fast-Forward:** Fast-forward merges are simple moves of the branch pointer. Non-fast-forward requires a merge or rebase due to divergent histories.
- **Use Branches:** Always work on a separate branch and merge it into the main branch once the work is complete. This keeps your main branch clean and stable.

By following these steps, you can easily handle remote rejections and ensure a smooth workflow when collaborating with others on Git projects. Happy coding! 🚀
